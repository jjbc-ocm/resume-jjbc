        "Hey, I'm Jilmer — a developer who loves turning game ideas into playable realities. I've worked across a variety of projects, from fast-paced PvP games on Telegram to space shooters with 50,000+ downloads. My favorite part of game dev is making things *feel* good — whether it's a snappy UI, satisfying combat, or smooth multiplayer.",
        "I mostly work with Unity, C#, and backend tools like Colyseus and AWS. I'm big on performance optimization, clean UI design, and shipping features that actually make a difference.",
        "When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me lifting weights, reading about game balance theory, or exploring new indie titles for inspiration. I'm always learning and always building."
